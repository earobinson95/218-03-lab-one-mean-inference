## Question 5

Remember there are four aspects we look at when describing a distribution: center (mean/median/mode), spread (how spread out is the data? SD/IQR, flat?, narrow?), shape (left skewed/right skewed/symmetrical), and outliers!

## Question 6

Nice job identifying independence and normality!

### Independance

Recall when evaluating independence, we are looking to see if there is a relationship between the observational units (person). Here each person's hours worked not depend on the others.

### Normality

What does the shape of the histogram look like? Do you see any outliers? Remember our sample size is relatively large (n = 500). 

## Question 10

### If they say "90% chance"

Careful! The true mean is either in our interval or not, but we don't know. So, we can't say we are 90% sure it is in there. It's either 0% or 100%. We can't estimate the chance that the parameter is in the interval. Instead, we are confident that if we make lots of intervals 90% of them should contain the
population mean.

### If they say "90% of the people"

Our confidence interval is for the population mean, not the number of people!
We are 90% confident the population mean hours worked per week for all working Americans is contained in our interval.

### If they reference the sample mean instead of the population mean

Careful! Our confidence interval is for the population mean, not the sample mean! We use our sample mean as the center of our confidence interval, so there
is a 100% chance that it is capture in the interval! We don't, however, know if
our interval contains the true population mean.

### If their interpretation doesn't contain context

"Which group of people are we interested in?"

"Is our interval for the number of hours worked in a day? A week? A year?"

## Question 11

### If they don't reject the null

When making a hypothesis test decision with a confidence interval, we look for the null value in the interval. Is 40 contained in your 90% confidence interval?

### If they talk about the interval being close to 40

The 90% interval already captured the uncertainty for the sample mean, so now we need to see whether the null value overlaps with the interval. When making a decision, we're not looking at how close or far 40 is from the interval. 

<!-- ## Question 12 -->

<!-- ### If they say "low probability of getting the null" -->

<!-- The p-value isn't the probability of getting the null, it is the probability of obtaining the results we saw or something more extreme **is the null was true.** -->

<!-- ### If they use 0.05 instead of 0.1 -->

<!-- Careful! Our significance level coincides with the confidence level we used. What percent confidence level did we use in the last problem? What significance level should you use? -->

<!-- ### General reminder about p-value interpretation -->

<!-- The p-value represents the probability of obtaining the results we did (sample mean) or something more extreme, if the null was true. Given the p-value we obtained is 3.76%, is it likely for us to have obtained a sample mean as large as what we saw due to chance alone? -->

<!-- ### General reminder about making a decision -->

<!-- Remember when making a hypothesis test decision, we either reject the null or fail to reject the null! -->
